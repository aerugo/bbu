            Babel Between Us is a collaborative literary project exploring the uncharted waters between collaboration, fiction and ethnography.<br/><br/>

            A group of 18 writers collectively improvised stories on the bbu.world <a href="https://bbu.world/c/babel-between-us/9">forum</a> from March to December 2020. The resulting fiction was read and annotated by a group of readers using experimental ethnographic methods. Their work was visualised as a <a href="http://server-2021.edgeryders.eu/dashboard/bbu/ethno-bbu?m=cn%7Ccl&cn.weightFilter=3&cn.labelDensity=0.67&cn.labelThreshold=7">"Semantic Social Network"</a>, which was then presented back to the writers.<br/><br/>

            Babel Between Us includes over 900 fragments of prose and poetry. Many of the fragments are parts of <a href="https://bbu.world/t/the-wonderful-journals-of-2020-first-edition/888">stories written as collaborative threads</a>. Some are <a href="https://bbu.world/t/copy-paste-like-a-lil-piece-of-clay-molding-writing-moldy-writing/1260/8">thematic explorations of form</a>. Some fragments are connected through <a href="http://server-2021.edgeryders.eu/dashboard/bbu/ethno-bbu?m=cn%7Cctl&cn.weightFilter=4&cn.labelDensity=0.67&cn.labelThreshold=7&cn.mode=scopeArea&sc.post=x%C2%9C%2B%C3%88%2F.%C2%8974%C2%B70%C2%AE)%00%C2%B3%2CM%C3%A0%2CSK(%C3%8B%C3%82%C3%90%14%C3%82224%C2%86%C3%8A%1A%19%1B%C2%98%40X%C3%86%06%C2%86%C2%960%C2%96%C2%81%01%00N%14%1A%C3%BA">shared symbolism and context</a>.<br/><br/>

            In the next step of the project we want to explore other ways to present volumes of annotated text, especially related to prose and poetry.<br/>
