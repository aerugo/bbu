            Babel Between Us is a literary experiment where 18 writers and 9 ethnographers from all over the world, over
            the course
            of two years, wrote collaboratively. The project resulted in a cartographic visualization of a
            collaboratively created
            world, exploring the uncharted waters between collaboration, fiction, and ethnography.<br/><br/>

            Our aim was to explore if a collaborative writing process could be aided by a digital ethnography made on
            the writing as
            it happened. The writers wrote on a forum, the ethnographers analyzed the writing as they happened, and fed
            this back to
            the writers, creating a feedback loop between the creative output and the analysis of it. We wanted to know
            how this
            affected the collaborative process, if it made it easier to get a grasp of the direction of the group, and
            if it opened
            new interesting entry points for the creative process.</p>

            The analysis was done through ethnographic coding, which essentially is adding labels to
            parts of the text of reocurring meaning. These labels are then mapped by grouping together concepts that
            often co-occur,
            resulting in a concept map over the fiction. For example, the ethnographic code “boundlessness” has often
            been applied
            together with codes such as “darkness” and “emptiness”.

                a tower is so
                tall no one knows how many floors there are.
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                'boundlessness' has often been applied together with meticulous categorisation, darkness, emptiness,
                death, limits of one's consciousness, accepting death, the university, bottleneck, pandemic,
                indifference,
                self-reflection, the city, recurring dream, dream-like quality and staircase

            The writing started in March 2020, just as the world went into lockdown. The writers contributed from their
            different
            corners of the world into what became a sort of remotely conducted Decamerone, weaving their real
            experiences of the
            pandemic with dreams of escapes to other worlds.

            As lockdowns succeeded one another we continued writing and analyzing, and slowly getting to know each other
            through the
            fiction we created. Fights occurred, friendships were formed, all through the texts. Some pretty serious
            arguments
            playing out, all through the medium of fictional characters. A lot of bad and a lot of good text was
            written.

            Soon an in-Babel mythology was formed, consisting of characters, places, and themes that appeared in
            different texts, as
            well as of metareferences to the project itself. The writers started communicating and planning in a secret
            backstage
            forum, plotting different schemes to subvert the ethnography team. Meanwhile, the ethnographers livestreamed
            monthly
            video calls where they discussed the evolution of the corpus, attempting to create a more realtime feedback
            process with
            the writers.

            The ethnographers tried to constantly adapt their process to suit the direction the writing was going, which
            ultimately
            led to a sprawling and inconsistent ethnography. We don&apos;t really know if this inconsistency is good or
            bad, but it was a
            result of the nature of the process. There are arguments for both consistency and inconsistency. But they
            both boil down
            to the question of “How to do an ethnography of fiction?”
            <br/><br/>
            All labels attached to the text should carry some sort of abstracted meaning from it, but who decides what
            constitutes
            meaning in this context? Is it what is meaningful for me, for the writer, or for a reader? Or is it rather
            what is
            useful for me, the writer, or the reader? The ethnography creates a map of the concepts present in the
            corpus, but who
            is this map for?
